## PANet Paper Summary

### What did the authors want to achieve ? 

- improve Computer Vision tasks object detection and mainly instance segmentation 
- build on top of Fast/ Faster /Mask RCNN and improve info propagation 
- design an architecture that can deal with blurry and heavy occlusion of the new datasets back then (2018) , like COCO 2017  
- use in-net feature hierarchy : top down path with lateral connections is augmented to emphasize strong sementical features 

### Methods used 
#### Findings 
- Mask RCNN : long path from low-level to topmost features, which makes it difficult to access localization information 
- Mask RCNN : only single view, losinance to gather diverse information
- Mask RCNN : predictions based on pooled feature grides that are assigned heuristicallyg ch, can be updated since lower level info can be important for final prediction  

#### Contributions 
- PANet is proposed for instance segementation
- 1) bottom-up path augmentation to shorten information path and improve featrue pyramid with accurate low-level information 
=> new : propagate low-level features to enhance the feature hierarchy for instance recogniton 
- 2) Adaptive feature pooling is introduced to recover broken information between each proposal and all feature levels 
- 3) for multi view : augmentation of mask prediction with small fc layers : more diverse info, masks have better quality 
- 1) & 2) are both used for detection and segmentation and lead to improvments of both tasks
