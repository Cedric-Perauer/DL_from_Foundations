# YOLOv4: Optimal Speed and Accuracy of Object Detection Paper Summary 
(Alexey Bochkovskiy,Chien-Yao Wang, Hong-Yuan Mark Liao)

## What did the authors want to achieve ? 
- fast (real time) object detection, that can be trained on a GPU with 8-16 GB of VRAM 
- a model that can be easily trained and used
- add state of the art methods for object detection, building on YOLOv3
- find a good model for both GPU and VPU implementation

## Methods used 

### Bag of Freebies (methods that only increase training runtime and not inference)


- New Data Augmentation techniques are used, for photometric and geometric variability : 
=> Random Erase, Cutout to leave part of image of certain value
=> Dropout, Dropblock does the same with the net params
- Mixup : mult image augmentation
- Style Transfer GAN for texture stability 
#### Dataset Bias : 
=> focal loss, data imbalance between different classics
=> one-hot hard representation 
=> soft labels 
BBox regression : 
- MSE has x and y independent, also Anchors
=> IoU loss => coverage and area are considered 
=> scale invariant, not the case with traditional methods
=> DIoU and CIoU loss


### Bag of specials (methods that only have a small impact on inference speed, but improve accuracy significantly)


- only a small cost of compute during inference, improve accuracy : 
	- enlarging receptive field : SPP, ASPP, RFB, SPP originates 		  from Spatial Pyramid Matching 
	  => extract bag of words features 
 	- SPP infeasible for FCN nets, as it outputs a 1D feature 	  vector => YOLOv3 concat of max pooling outputs with 		  kxk kernel size => larger receptive field of the backbone 		  => 2.7% higher AP50, 0.5 more compute necessary
	- ASPP diff. to SPP : max pool of 3x3, dilation of k 
	- RFB : several dilated kxk convs => 7% more AP, 5.7% more compute
Attention module : 
- mainly channelwise and pointwise attention, SE and SAM modules, SAM with no extra cost on GPU => better for us                    
Feature Integration : 
- skip connections, hyper-column 
- channelwise weighting on multi-scale with FPN methods : 
  - SFAM, ASFF, BiFPN, ...
Activation Functions : 
	- Mish, Swish, (fully differentiable) PReLu, ...
Post-processing : 
	- NMS "messy" with occlusions => DIoU NMS distance : center to BBox screening process
    - NMS method not necessary in anchor free method 
	

### Architecture Selection 

- things to think about : a reference that is good for classification is not always good for object detection, due to the detector needing : 
    - higher input size (for small objects)
    - more layers (higher receptive field to cover larger input)
    - more parameters (for greater capacity, to detect different sized objects)

=> a detector needs a backbone with more 3x3 convs and more params

Due to that, CSPDarknet53 seems to be the best choice in theory

The following improvements are done : 
+ SPP additional module for larger receptive field (almost no runtime disadvantage)
+ PANet path-aggregation neck as param aggregation method instead of FPN from YOLOv3
-  YOLOv3 anchor based head is used  
- DropBlock regularization method 

For single GPU training : 
- synchBN is not considered : goal is to run on single GPU, thanks guys !!
- new data augmentation mosaic (mixes 4 training images), Self Adversarial Training => detection of objects outside their context  
SAT : 
Forward Backward Training : 
1) adversarial attack is performed on input
2) neural net is trained to detect and object on this moded image in a normal way 

Also : 
- optimal hyper-params while applying genetic algos
- Cross mini Batch Normalization : mini-batch split within batch 
- SAM is modified from spatial-wise to pointwise attention, as can be seen below :
