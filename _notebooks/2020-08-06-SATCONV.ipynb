    "Combat the deficits of Conolutional Architectures, (local connectivity, failing to reason globally) by introducing Attention to as a stand-alone layer. The authors prove that this can be both more accurate and more efficient at the same time. Architectures that are attention only, and a mixed version of convolutional and attention architectures are introduced and compared to the vanilla convolutional implementations. \n"
