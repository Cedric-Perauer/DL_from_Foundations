    "- $H(X)$ is considered to be the mapping of a few stacked layers. The idea of Residual Blocks, is that this mapping function $H(x) = F(x) + x$ can more easily be learned when we let it approximate this Residual funciton. This is based on the degradation problem, which suggests that the solvers\n",
    "might have difficulties in approximating identity mappings\n",
    "by multiple nonlinear layers. The identity mapping should then allow deeper models to have an error no greater than that of a shallow counterpart. In reality, the identity mapping probably is not optimal, but it can still allow us to pre-condition the problem. This is shown by the small responese of the learned residual functions, which suggest that these mappings provide reasonable preconditioning. If the residual funciton has only a single layer, it resembles a linear function $y = W*x +x$, which is why an advantage can only be observed with more than one layer. \n",

At first Plain Networks are compared to it's respective ResNet with identity mapping and 0 padding, which does not add extra parameters. The results show that the degradation error is adressed better which allows better performance with increased depth and allowed them to win the ImageNet Challenge in 2015.
