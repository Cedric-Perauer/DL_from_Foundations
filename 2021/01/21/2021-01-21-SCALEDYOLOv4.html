<h2 id="Goal-of-the-Authors">Goal of the Authors<a class="anchor-link" href="#Goal-of-the-Authors"> </a></h2><ul>
<li>design an efficient model scaling technique, according to them : EfficientDet, SpineNet,RegNet 
  scaling is all good work but they do not analyze the relation between parameters like model depth, model witdh,
  input resolution, group width, bottleneck ratio</li>
<li>the good performance of normal YOLOv4 is due to the CSP Darknet53 Backbone fulffilling optimal parameters as 
found through architecture search (depth of 65, bottleneck ratio of 1 and width growth ratio of 2)   </li>
<li>based on YOlOv4, they develop YOLOv4-CSP and based on that they scale to YOLO Scaled</li>
<li>they aim to design a good scaling technique for both large and small models, analyze the relations between scaling 
factors</li>
<li>FPN is confirmed to be a once for all model element</li>
<li>model with fast runtime (2 stage detectors are not part of this), anchor based approaches are not as nice as CenterNet but perform better </li>

<h2 id="Methods/Structure">Methods/Structure<a class="anchor-link" href="#Methods/Structure"> </a></h2><h3 id="Scaling-Larger-Models">Scaling Larger Models<a class="anchor-link" href="#Scaling-Larger-Models"> </a></h3><p>When looking at the compute cost of different layer types in relation to input resolution $\alpha$, number of layers $\beta$ and number of channels  $\gamma$ the authors find the following : 
<img src="/DL_from_Foundations/images/copied_from_nb/images/scaling.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Using CSP Connections, compute cost can be reduced to :</p>
<p><img src="/DL_from_Foundations/images/copied_from_nb/images/csp_scale.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Further advantages of CSP are accuracy gains and faster inference, therefore no tradeoff exists.</p>
<p>The different scaling factors for an object detection model are displayed in the table below :</p>
<p><img src="/DL_from_Foundations/images/copied_from_nb/images/csp_scalefacts.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>"The biggest difference between image classification and object detection is that the former only needs to identify the category of the largest component in an image, while the lat- ter needs to predict the position and size of each object in an image."</p>
<p>This ability for a single stage object detector (the receptive field) is most accurately described by the stage. Higher stages are more suitable for predicting larger objects (FPN). The effect of the receptive field according to different parameters is shown below :</p>

<h3 id="Scaling-Models-for-Embedded-Devices">Scaling Models for Embedded Devices<a class="anchor-link" href="#Scaling-Models-for-Embedded-Devices"> </a></h3><p>The authors consider DRAM and inference speed and select a criteria for models that can run on lower end devices in real time. The criterion for this is a runtime that scales with at most $O(w*h*k*b^{2})$</p>

<h4 id="Minimize/balance-size-of-feature-map">Minimize/balance size of feature map<a class="anchor-link" href="#Minimize/balance-size-of-feature-map"> </a></h4><p>Because OSANet has a lower compute cost $O(max(whbg,whkb^{2}))$ than Dense Net $O(whgbk)$</p>
<p>The authors also emphasize on minimizing the feature maps. Feature maps have to be treated as a whole in terms of a block (Dense Net, ResNet Block). 
The feature that  "Because the computational block of OSANet belongs to the PlainNet architecture, making CSPNet from any layer of a computational block can achieve the effect of gradient truncation" is exploited to efficiently partition the paths from $b+kg$ to $(b+kg)/2$. When hardware latency τ is considered, this results in : $ceil((b + kg)/2τ ) × τ$</p>
<h4 id="Maintain-the-same-number-of-channels-after-convolution">Maintain the same number of channels after convolution<a class="anchor-link" href="#Maintain-the-same-number-of-channels-after-convolution"> </a></h4><p>In terms of power consumption, memory access cost is also a large factor on embedded Hardware. 
It can be calculated as follows :</p>
<p>$MAC = hw(C_{in} + C_{out}) + KC_{in}C_{out}$</p>
<p>h,w, C (in and out) and K are height and width of feature map, the channel number of input and output, and the kernel size of the convolutional filter.</p>

<h4 id="Minimize-Convolutional-Input/Output-(CIO)">Minimize Convolutional Input/Output (CIO)<a class="anchor-link" href="#Minimize-Convolutional-Input/Output-(CIO)"> </a></h4><p>CIO can measure the DRAM in and output. When kg &gt; b/2 CSPOSANET minimizes this according to:</p>

<h3 id="Scaling">Scaling<a class="anchor-link" href="#Scaling"> </a></h3><h4 id="Backbone">Backbone<a class="anchor-link" href="#Backbone"> </a></h4><p>"In the design of CSPDarknet53, the computation of down-sampling convolution for cross-stage process is not included in a residual block." That's why the CSPDarknet53 has a compute of whb2(9/4+3/4+5k/2). From the runtime analysis in the beginning, CSP Net only has a better runtime than CSPDarknet when k &gt; 1. Therefore in order to keep a decent runtime, the first CSP stage is converted to a Darknet layer :</p>

<h4 id="Neck">Neck<a class="anchor-link" href="#Neck"> </a></h4><p>PANet Neck of Yolov4 is made 40% more compute efficient by CSPizing it." It mainly intagrates the features from different feature pyramids, and then passes through two sets of reversed Darknet residual layer without shortcut connections."</p>
